# Program Meta Information

A collection of information that should be generally useful to program participants.


## Etiquette For This Repository

The goal of this repository is to be:

- An informational resource for how the apprenticeship program operates.
- A coordination point for people participating in the program.
- A historical record of prior projects.
- A collection of useful resources for future program participants.

Anything that you wish to do that better serves this goal is probably ok. Ask if you are unsure. Feel free to be bold and simply open a pull request with the changes and we can discuss them there.


### Using `./notes/<your-name>.md`

Feel free to create a document under the path `./notes/<your-name>.md`. This document should be used for things like:

- Aggregating links to reading resources you've found useful.
- Writing down notes about potential projects.
- Fleshing out full details of potential projects.
- Development updates.

This document isn't meant to be a "profile".


### Merging Pull Requests

Merge access will be granted relatively widely. Use your best judgement. Ask if you are unsure.


## Development Updates

One of the core goals of this program is to improve your technical writing and communication skills. One of the ways to do this is to get comfortable telling people about what you are working on. So one of the expectations for program participants is a regularly cadenced development update. For the duration of the program, all participants should publish a development update at least once every two weeks.

A good development update can take many forms. Every individual will probably need to find their own style. Here are some suggestions.

- You don't need to explain everything, but sometimes it is good to try and explain things to see if you know how.
- A bulleted list of factual statements about what you worked on is a great place to start.
- Links are great. Forum posts. Pull requests. HackMD documents.

A great example are Danny Ryan's "finalized" series of development updates. Here's a recent one: https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/04/02/finalized-no-25/

You should: 

- post your first update within the first week of starting into the program.
- post your update somewhere public. Using the main [`development-updates.md` document](./development-updates.md) is fine.  An external blog or forum post are also great.
- *if* you post your update somewhere external, you should provide a URL referencing your development update in the [`development-updates.md` document](./development-updates.md).
