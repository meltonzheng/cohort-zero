# Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some frequently asked questions that may be useful.


- **Will I learn to develop applications on the Ethereum blockchain?**
    - No. This program is not focused on application development
- **I'm not able to commit to "full time" (aka 40 hours a week).  Can I still apply?**
    - Yes. There are no hard restrictions on how many hours you must put towards the program.  The amount of time you will need to invest is going to depend on your current level of knowledge and what project you choose to pursue.  It will likely be difficult to be successful in the program if you are unable to commit at least 20 hours per week.
- **I don't know much about ______________.  Can I still apply?**
    - Yes. Applicants are expected to have gaps in their knowledge.  You should still read through the [program details](./program-details.md) to get a sense for what type of prior knowledge you should be working towards to be successful in the program.
- **What happens after the 4 months is complete?**
    - Assuming you are "successful" in the program we will work to continue "enabling" you to focus your effort on the protocol.  This could be continued "grant" style funding, helping you find a job on a team that's working on something interesting to you, or whatever it is that we can help with to keep you working with us.
If the program shows promise then we'll probably try to rope you into helping out with the next cohort.
- **Will funding be in ETH or Fiat?**
    - ETH or Fiat should both be available.
- **Will there be an interview process?**
    - Yes.  There will be an initial round of filtering and then we'll do interviews.
- **How many applicants will be accepted in the first cohort?**
    - For this first cohort, the number that we formally accept is going to be very small.  We don't have an exact number but very likely it will be less than 6.  This is the first time we're doing this.  There's going to be things that we get wrong.  There's going to be stuff that we figure out as we go.  If the program is working, we'll start the second cohort midway through the program so that there is overlap and the first cohort can help onboard the second cohort. 
- **Can I still participate even if I am not selected in this cohort?**
    - Yes. Being "selected" into the program is really just the group that we'll be working directly with to provide funding.  The program is going to happen in the "open" meaning that anyone who wants to participate can be a part of the program on the same footing as those that are "selected".
We're looking into how we can provide some support for those that don't get selected but who choose to be a part of the program anyway.  There will probably be an opportunity for those that aren't selected, but who do need funding to do this, to apply for a grant.
