# Melton's notes
I know nothing
## What I'm interested in: Eth1 to Eth2
[Detailed transition](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-eth1-eth2-transition/6265)
Stole the below headings from [Guide to Eth2 upgrades](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2)  
## The Beacon Chain
### TODO:
- So apparently it's live?
- Wtf is this? [Maybe it's this?](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md)
- [Infinite amount of info](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs#phase-0) that I don't really understand
- Are there any issues?
## The Merge
### TODO:
- Why ~2021/22?
- What is it? [Reading](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/merge/)
- [Stateless Client Concept](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-stateless-client-concept/172)
- Are there any issues?
### Possible Project
- Clean up certain EVM Features [Reading](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/evm_feature_removing) 
    - Since the Merge is the best time to do it

| Features         | Progress so far |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| 2300 Gas Stipend | ?               |     
| Gas Visibility   |                 |     
| Gas Refunds      |                 |     
| Other            |                 |     

|Pros| Cons|
|-----|-----|
|Contribute (sorta) to the merge. |Currently don't know the progress for these things yet|
|Link to these features already explain possible changes like "the 2300 number could either be replaced with 0 (no child execution) or with infinity (child execution gets all the gas from the parent)"||
|Lots of options (3*)||
*There's also RIPEMD160 precompile, dynamic jumps, and MODEXP precompile
## The Shard Chain
### TODO:
- Why 2022?
- So what is it? [Reading](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/shard-chains/)
- [Super useful intro stuff](https://eth.wiki/sharding/Sharding-FAQs)
- Are there any issues?
